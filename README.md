Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides a simulation of:

1. Shortest Job First (SJF)
2. Longest Job First (LJF)
3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
4. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
5. Round Robin (RR)
The program takes process details as input and computes scheduling results, including turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

Features
✅ Supports multiple scheduling algorithms
✅ Computes turnaround and waiting times
✅ Interactive input and output
✅ Clear visualization of process execution order
